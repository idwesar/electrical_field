# electrical_field

You have a box of infinite depth with two wires running through it. The wires have a charge of +10V and -10V respectively and the edge of the box is permanently grounded to 0V - calculate the voltage in each 'square' of the box and then calculate the electrical field within it.

This is a project undertaken to help me learn how to use numpy and matplotlib and is a work in progress!
